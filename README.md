# Discord Point Casino

Presenting a point system to implement to your discord server that lets active users gain points by being active in voice channels. Built with <a href ="https://discord.js.org/#/">Discord.js</a>, you can run this with a discord bot locally (local machine, personal server, RasPberry, etc) or any PaaS (Heroku, AWS, etc).

The bot will scan through the discord server, find all voice channels and assign points to currently connected users for them to spend on casino-type activities.

Included in the bot:

<ul>
  <li>Creation of user accounts</li>
  <li>Even/Odd, Roulette, All-In gambling, with a chance to hit a critical win for 2x the winnings</li>
  <li>One-on-One point dueling</li>
  <li>Point transferring to other users</li>
  <li>Personal and global statistic tracking</li>
  <li>Lottery system (funded by point transfer taxes and gambling losses)</li>
</ul>

All numbers and odds are completely customizable within the source code under each respective function.

This is a system that solely plays with points, with nothing monetary involved-- for pure fun. This project was inspired by the channel point system implemented on Twitch.tv.
